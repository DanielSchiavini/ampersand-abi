\subsection{Future road map}

Not surprisingly, several of the current weaknesses of the methodology will be addressed in the future Ampersand road map to strengthen the power of the Ampersand Approach:
\begin{description}
	\item[Improved generator] Instead of working prototypes, a more powerful generator will be built that can generate complex and full-scale systems.
	\item[Structure repository] The requirements engineer will be offered a wide range of standard structures as a starting point to further tune to the specific project requirements.
	This will allow the requirements engineer to focus more on the specific requirements needs.
	\item[Graphical user interface] A GUI will provide a full blown working environment for the requirement engineer providing real time syntax and other structure issues. 
	This will reduce the amount of errors found during compilation and hence increase the efficiency and user satisfaction. 
	A good compiler that provides useful feedback will remain important to tackle the issues not found in real-time during the requirement editing.
	\item[Agile approach] Short functional iterations, in which prototypes are generated, will be supported to embed the base principles of agile approaches.
	\item[Feedback of compiler messages] As part of this project, the compiler will be revised to provide clear and useful errors messages.
\end{description}

\subsection{Concluding remarks}
Without doubt, the application of formal methods can enhance the quality of the actual delivered system as the quality of the full software engineering process. 
Besides the positive effects, most of the formal techniques include some disadvantages due to which these methods are often neglected. 
During the elaboration of the Ampersand method, Joosten clearly focused on a method, and supporting tools, that can be used on large real life projects. 
The use of relational algebra to assure end-2-end consistency, the formatting of requirements in natural language for business user alignment together with the supporting tools which automate, otherwise time consuming, checks and  generate useful design artifacts including working prototypes is ground-breaking.

The Ampersand methodology has a large potential to gain an important position next to other formal methods. 
Two identified weaknesses, the quality of the feedback and the maintainability of the code will be tackled in the next phases of the graduation project of  Daniel S.C. Schiavini and Maarten Baertsoen.
