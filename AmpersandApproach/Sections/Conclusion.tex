todo: alignment Stef

\subsection{Conclusive remarks}
Without doubt, the appliance of formal methods can enhance the quality of the actual delivered system as the quality of the full software engineering process. 
Besides the positive effects most of the formal techniques include some disadvantages due to which these methods are often neglected. 
During the elaboration of the Ampersand method, Prof.dr. Stef Joosten clearly focused on a method, and supporting tools, than can be used on large real life projects. 
The use of relational algebra to assure end-2-end consistency, the formatting of requirements in natural language for business user alignment together with the supporting tools which automate, otherwise time consuming, checks and  generate useful design artifacts including working prototypes is ground-braking.

The Ampersand methodology has a large potential to gain an important position next to other important formal methods. 
Two identified weaknesses, the quality of the feedback and the maintainability of the code will be tackled in the next phases of the graduation project of  Daniel S.C. Schiavini and Maarten Baertsoen.
