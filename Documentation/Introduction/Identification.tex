\subsection{Identification}
This document contains the documentation of the project `Useful feedback in the Ampersand parser'.
The document is the milestone product of the project phase 3d and contains the deliverables `analysis \& design' and `test report', as described in the project planning \citenac{plan}.

This document is part of the graduation project of the computer science bachelor at the Open Universiteit Nederland.
The project `Useful feedback in the Ampersand parser' is executed in collaboration with Maarten Baertsoen, with support of the supervisor Dr. Bastiaan Heeren and examiner Prof.dr. Marko C.J.D. van Eekelen.
The assignment is given by Prof.dr. Stef Joosten, who researches how to further automate the design of business processes and information systems by the development of the Ampersand project.

Ampersand is an approach for the use of business rules to define the business processes.
Users describe the business rules in a formal language (ADL), and Ampersand compiles those rules into functional specification, documentation and working software prototypes.
The main objective of this project is to improve the feedback and maintainability of the Ampersand parser.
See \citenac{plan} for more details on the project.
