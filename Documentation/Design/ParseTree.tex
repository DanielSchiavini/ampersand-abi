\subsection{Parse tree (R-M)}
\label{subsec:design-parse-tree}
Improvements in the Ampersand parse tree are out of the scope of this project, because of the potential consequences to the rest of the Ampersand system.
However, during the development of the new parser a few constructions have been changed in order to make the parser more readable and maintainable.
The changes have been mostly in the order of the constructor parameters, and this was done consequently though all Ampersand modules.
The updated parse tree is depicted in the appendices (\autoref{fig:parse-tree}).
