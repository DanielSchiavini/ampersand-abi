\section{Assessment}
\label{sec:assessment}
In this section, we look backwards and explain why some decisions were taken.
In \autoref{assessment:team} we show that we believe the new parser is an adequate improvement to Ampersand and assess approach, roles and collaboration within the team.
In \autoref{assessment:lessons-learned} we talk about what we would do differently if we were to start the project over again.
Then, in \autoref{assessment:competences} our chosen academic competences are evaluated.
Finally, in the Sections \ref{subsec:assessment-daniel} and \ref{subsec:assessment-maarten}, each of the project members go shortly into their experiences en learning moments.
