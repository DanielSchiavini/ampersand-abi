\section{Assessment}
\label{sec:assessment}
In this section, we look backwards and explain why some decisions were taken.
In \ref{subsec:assessment-process} we show that we believe the new parser is an adequate improvement to Ampersand.
Then, in \ref{subsec:assessment-approach} we focus on the approach, roles and collaboration within the team.
Finally, in the sections \ref{subsec:assessment-daniel} and \ref{subsec:assessment-maarten}, each of the project members go shortly into their experiences en learning moments.
