\subsection{Team assessment}
\label{assessment:team}
During the planning phase we have defined an elaborate process of deliveries and feedback sessions.
We planned for instance to maintain a backlog of all the features still to be implemented.
This process ended up being too structured considering the flexible nature of the Open University.

The actual executed process did, however, work rather well.
Stef did not have time to answer every e-mail or test every release.
On the other hand, he was very friendly and understanding when we had less to deliver than what he expected, or when we had to actually delay our delivery dates.
The trust and independence given to us has thus been important to the success of this project.

The support from our supervisor, Bastiaan Heeren, has been extremely important during each of the iterations.
We met every three weeks, either via video-conferencing or in person and we always had enough questions.
His fast and precise feedback helped us increase the quality of all documents and code.
But mainly his guidance has been a key stone in the last months.

The cooperation between the project members is described below in each of the individual assessments.
