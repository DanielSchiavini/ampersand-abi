\section{User-friendly error messages}
\label{sec:errors}
The most important feature of the parser that will be built, is that it should generate user-friendly error messages.
To understand what kinds of messages can be (and should be) generated, a research will be done on what good errors are and how to generate them.

This is also related to the choice of the parsing library, since the chosen library should support the generation of good errors without extensive effort.
Coincidently, a good source of knowledge are the papers of the supervisor, Bastiaan Heeren, who has done his PhD thesis on the generation of top quality type error messages\cite{heeren-error}.
