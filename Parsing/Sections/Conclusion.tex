\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In \autoref{sec:libraries}, the choice was made to use a combinator library for the new parser of Ampersand.
The main reason to avoid the parser generators is that it is hard to generate useful feedback.
Then, in \autoref{sec:errors}, it was made even more clear that besides generating good messages, those messages should also be customizable.
Therefore, the advise is to use the combinator library that offers the highest level of customization in error messages.
Based on the experiences from the Helium compiler \cite{helium-parser}, the advise is to also use the Parsec library.
This library offers better support and more customization options.

Besides the choice of the library, a list of important attention points has been found in the literature and can be found in \autoref{sec:errors}.
