Ampersand is an approach for giving business rules a larger role in the software development process.
The Ampersand compiler allows users to write business rules in a domain specific language (ADL) and process them into design artifacts, documentation and software prototypes.
The project became ever larger and users started having issues with the error messages of bad quality generated by the tool.
Mainly for the new users the bad quality of error messages were a large obstacle.

Our assignment, given by Prof.dr. Stef Joosten, is thus to redesign and implement a new parser for Ampersand.
In order to improve the error messages, Daniel Schiavini has researched the qualities of error messages and the options for parsing within Haskell.
The main conclusion was to rewrite the parser using another parsing library, namely Parsec.
On the other hand, Maarten Baertsoen researched business rules and the Ampersand approach more thoroughly.

In order to guarantee the quality of the software delivered, we implemented a new library for testing the parser automatically.
We added the possibility to `pretty print' the parsing tree back into ADL code.
Several efforts have been made to improve the code quality in the aspects of readability, extensibility, maintainability, documentation and performance.

During development, we often merged the development code with the other developments.
While this cost some effort, it allowed us to take the new parser into production as soon as it was ready.

Besides improvements in the parser itself, we have studied the ADL grammar.
The grammar documentation was not up-to-date, so it was our task to reverse engineer the code to determine the recognized language.
The updated grammar is now available as code annotations and documentation.
In order to make the grammar more clear, performant and unambiguous, refactorings were applied without changing the language accepted by the parser.

Finally, a through analysis on the error messages showed that while the old parser gave good error messages in 22\% of the time, the new parser improved this percentage to 82\%.
Also, bad quality messages went from 56\% to 1\%.

In this presentation, we will show how the new parser will allow for Ampersand to continue growing.
This will save time and effort for students, researchers and commercial users.
