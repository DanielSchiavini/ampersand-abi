\subsection{Next steps (R-M)}
\label{tests:next-steps}
  In this section we name a couple changes that can be done in the test suite in the future:
  \begin{description}
    \item[Sentinel] During the development of the new parser, we worked in a separate fork.
      Our changes were not being tested in the Ampersand test server (Sentinel).
      Since we did not have access to this server, we developed a separate test suite.
      It may be pertinent to integrate the Sentinel jobs into the test suite or to integrate the test suite into the Sentinel jobs.
    
    \item[Output] Currently, the test suite outputs errors by using the \texttt{Debug.Trace} module.
      From a purely functional perspective, using this module may be undesirable.
      Therefore, the Ampersand team may consider changing the test outputs to use IO with monads in a more functional way.
  \end{description}
