\section{Recommendations}
\label{sec:recommendations}
Although we believe the new parser is a large step forward, we also recognize that there are still improvements to be made.

Ampersand is growing and changing in a fast pace.
This is a direct consequence of a project involved with research and active development.
In such projects, it is often impossible to predict which functionalities will be necessary and to design the domain-specific language accordingly beforehand.

As expected we see that most of the remaining issues are related to the grammar ambiguities that force backtracking.
Also the parse tree is not consistently designed.
These issues are mentioned in \autoref{recommendations:design}.
Other improvements are also possible in the test framework delivered.
Those are mentioned in \autoref{recommendations:tests}.
