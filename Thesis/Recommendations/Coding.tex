% besprekingvan alle mogelijke code verbeteringen die we door ene impact op de parse tree of andere redenen niet behandeld hebben

\subsection{Coding (R-D)}
In the actual parser code, some smaller improvement topics are identified.
Resolving these independent minor topics impacts however the parse tree and therefore, these modifications are still open.
providing a exhaustive overview of these topics in this document would jeopardize the briefness and conciseness of this document.
All improvement topics are however fully documented in the code itself.
