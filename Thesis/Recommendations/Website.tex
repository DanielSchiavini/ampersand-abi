\subsection{Website and wiki}
\label{recommendations:website}
During the initiation phase of the project we tried to gather as much information as possible regarding the Ampersand project.
The Ampersand project currently has two information sources, a Wiki page and a GitHub page.
The Wiki page focuses on the goals and the practical usage of Ampersand where the GitHub page is more oriented to the Ampersand developers.

We experienced that is was not always easy to find the information we were looking for on these sites.
Some information was outdated and sometimes links were broken. 
Our suggestion is to have both sites more aligned to each other and to take some time to refresh the current Wiki pages.
This will make it easier for new Ampersand users and developers to have a kick-start in the Ampersand world.
It may also make it more attractive for open source developers to support the project.
