Before designing a new parser, it is important to understand the current system and where the improvement points are.
It is important thus to establish a solid foundation of the existing system and the environment in which the system is used.
In this domain and techniques analysis we make sure that the knowledge is sufficiently gathered through individual research.

The research of Maarten is focused on the goals of the Ampersand approach as a whole, within the domain of formal specification techniques.
It focuses on the Ampersand vision, the methodology, the way Ampersand is used in practice and the future road-map of the Ampersand approach.
The results are described in \autoref{domain:approach}.

Daniel investigated the domain of user friendly error messages and how to create them.
His research describes the technical considerations to take into account when selecting a new parser.
Based on the acquired insight, a new parsing library has been selected.
The results are described in \autoref{domain:parsing}.
