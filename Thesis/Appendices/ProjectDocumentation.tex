All the necessary information for the evaluation and usage of the new Ampersand parser that is not included in this thesis has been delivered separately in the project documentation.
The documentation contains the following artifacts:
\begin{description}
  \item [Code] A copy of the code itself, as delivered through GitHub.
  \item [Diagrams] Several design diagrams with the parse tree and Haskell modules.
  \item [Ebnf] The EBNF grammar of ADL in text and interactive diagram format.
  \item [Errors] The complete list with the comparison between the old and the new parser and the source code for each tested error.
  \item [HLint] Report with the static code analysis of HLint.
  \item [Hpc] Haskell program coverage for the test suite.
  \item [Haddock] The code documentation exported to HTML with the Haddock tool.
  \item [Notepad++] XML file that can be used to display ADL code in Notepad++.
