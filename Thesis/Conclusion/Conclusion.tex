\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Based on the error result analysis as described in section \autoref{tests:errors} and the overall code maintainability actions, we believe we succeeded in the realization of our project goals.
It must be said that it will take some time before the actual benefits will be visible because it takes some time before the Ampersand users can be interrogated regarding the improved user feedback from the parser.
One of the criteria to further stimulate and promote the introduction of Ampersand in both commercial and educational contexts is the availability of a large user base.
We are convinced that this project will improve the customer satisfaction, which on its turn will have a positive feedback on the user base extension.
The recommendations mentioned in this document can further support this growth.
