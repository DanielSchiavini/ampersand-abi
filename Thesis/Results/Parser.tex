\subsection{New Parser (D)}
\label{results:parser}
While the new parser may still be recognizable for the Ampersand developers, several improvements have been made.
In this subsection, we depict the high-level architecture of the parser.
In the remainder of this section, other aspects of the new parser are covered: Code quality in \autoref{results:code-quality}, improved error messages in \autoref{results:errors} and the new test suite in \autoref{results:tests}.
A more complete documentation of all delivered software is given in the project documentation \citepr{documentation}.

As decided during the research for domain \& techniques (see \autoref{domain:parsing}), the parser has been rebuilt with the Parsec combinator library.
