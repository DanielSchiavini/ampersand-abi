\subsection{Document overview (D)}
In this section we have given a short introduction to our graduation thesis.
Now, in \autoref{sec:objectives} we will despict the project's objectives and requirements.
We perform a domain analysis in \autoref{sec:domain} (phase 3a) and in \autoref{sec:research-context} we describe our investigation on the research context (phase 3b).

The phase 3c of the project started with a an as-is analysis, described in \autoref{sec:analysis}.
After the analysis, the design and implementation follow in \autoref{sec:design-implementation}, and the tests in \autoref{sec:tests}.

Finally we give our next step recommendations in \autoref{sec:recommendations} and a conclusion in \autoref{sec:conclusion}.
