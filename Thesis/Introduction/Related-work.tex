\subsection{Related work}
In the project phase 3a (domains \& techniques) \citepr{parsing,ampersand-approach} and phase 3b (research context) \citepr{research-context}, multiple references are made to related publications.
The documents providing additional insights or achievements related to the topics we touched during this project are listed below for further reference:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Deriving Functional Specifications from Business Requirements with Ampersand}:
    This paper \citenac{joosten2007deriving} written by Stef Joosten provides an overview of the goals of the Ampersand Approach and the way these goals are achieved. 
    The ampersand rules together with the examples helped us as a starting point to get to know Ampersand and to  reflect on in case of doubts.
  \item \textbf{Parsec, a fast combinator parser}:
    An useful document \citeac{parsec-fast} written by Daan Leijen about Parsec.
    The document gives a step by step guideline on how to use and implement a Haskell combinator library.
  \item \textbf{Bedrijfsregels in verschillende vormen}:
    The master thesis \citeac{bos2013bedrijfsregels} from Pim Bos in which a comparative research is outlined between the Semantic Web Rule Language and the Ampersand Language, including their supporting tools.
