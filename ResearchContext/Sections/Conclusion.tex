\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The Ampersand approach is situated within several research contexts, such as the Business Rule Approach and formal systems.
Additionally, the Ampersand Parser is part of a broader parser research context.
Our conclusion is that the new Ampersand parser has a very small influence in its research context for business rules.
This parser does not offer any new features or improvements to the language.
The largest influence of the project is commercial and educational by improving the user experience.
We expect that the new parser will allow commercial, research and educational users to do their work faster and more efficiently.
