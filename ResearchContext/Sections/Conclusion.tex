\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our conclusion is that the new Ampersand parser has a very small influence in its research context for business rules.
This parser does not offer any new features or improvements to the language.
The largest influence of the project is commercial and educational.
We expect that the new parser will allow commercial, research and educational users to do their work faster and more efficiently.
