\section{Assumptions and constraints (R-M)}
\label{sec:assumptions-constraints}
The following assumptions and constraints are considered in this project plan:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the main objectives, only the parser needs to be changed much.
		It is assumed that the changes in other parts of the software will be very limited.
	\item The project members will need to spend time building up knowledge on various involved parts:
		business rules, Ampersand, Haskell, LaTeX, etc.
	\item The architecture as described by the customer and documented on the Ampersand Wiki is assumed to be correct and up-to-date.
	\item The delivered software will be reviewed and tested by the relevant parties within a week.
	\item The customer and supervisor will be able to answer questions, give support, feedback and advice without much delay.
	\item The assumption is made that two project members will be available for an average of 12 hours a week.
		This can be influenced by the members' jobs or private lives.
\end{itemize}
