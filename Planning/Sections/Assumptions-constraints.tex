\section{Assumptions and constraints}
\label{sec:assumptions-constraints}
The following assumptions and constraints are considered in this project plan:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the main objectives, the majority of the changes are concentrated in the parser.
		It is assumed that the changes in other parts of the software will be very limited.
	\item The project members will need to spend time building up knowledge on various involved parts:
		business rules, Ampersand, Haskell, LaTeX, etc.
	\item The architecture as described by the customer and documented on the Ampersand Wiki is assumed to be correct and up-to-date.
	\item The delivered software will be reviewed and tested by the relevant parties within a week.
	\item The customer and supervisor will be able to answer questions, give support, feedback and advice without much delay.
	\item The assumption is made that two project members will be available for an average of 12 hours a week.
		This can be influenced by the members' jobs or private lives.
	\item Regression testing can be done using the available Sentinel Server
	\item Given the major impact on the parser part, we assume that this project team has the lead over the parser code during the project.
		Any fixes are changes on the parser outside the project team will be aligned first on impact and coherence with the ongoing parser changes.
\end{itemize}
