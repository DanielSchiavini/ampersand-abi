\section{Documentation}
\label{sec:documentation}
\subsection{Documentation plan}
Just like the project itself, the documentation will be managed as an iterative product.
All project documentation templates, forming the basis for the documentation deliverables, will be created before the start of phase 3b (research context), and all analysis, design and coding documentation will be maintained on a weekly basis.

Each sprint delivery, the available set of documentation will be delivered informally towards the project supervisor and, where useful, towards the customer.

\subsection{Documentation deliverables}
All documentation deliverables listed in section \ref{subsec:planning-milestones-deliverables} (\nameref{subsec:planning-milestones-deliverables}) are explained in some more detail in this section.

\subsubsection{Scientific article}
Each individual project team member will deliver an in depth analysis of one or more topics regarding the environment in which the system is, or will be, used.
This deliverable will cover at least the mandatory topics as described on the course site of the OU, such as: problem definition, context, used techniques, results and conclusions.


\subsubsection{Detailed report of the `research context'}
The detailed report of the `research context' will cover at least following topics:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Context
		\item Conclusions of the researcher
		\item Conclusions in regards to the project
		\item Glossary
		\item Bibliography
		\item Appendices, if useful
	\end {enumerate}

\subsubsection{Analysis \& design}
The `analysis \& design document' will cover at least following topics:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Design decisions and the reasoning behind them
		\item Detailed solution design
		\item Implementation guidelines \& coding conventions
		\item Tools \& libraries used in the project
	\end {enumerate}

\subsubsection{Test report}
The `Test report' will cover at least the following topics: overview of the test scenarios, the test results and the conclusions.

\subsubsection{Source code}
The source code will be documented in the code itself.
It is of utmost importance that the code is documented in a clear and concise way.
Topics needing a more elaborated documentation approach will be documented in the deliverable IT documentation.

\subsubsection{IT documentation}
Some coding structures, or the architectural design principles behind it, can require some additional documentation which could pollute the source code itself.
The IT documentation deliverable will list complex coding structures and the clarification of them including the overall technical architecture, in accordance with the project scope and the technical design principles.

The IT documentation must provide the necessary support to our customer to fully understand the project coding and it needs to present a solid basis on which future design and implementation decisions can be taken.

\subsubsection{Project documentation document}
The project will be concluded in a general project documentation document.
This deliverable will conclude all main deliverables, where possible, in a brief way.

The following additional topics will be documented to close the project:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Main realizations
		\item Encountered issues \& risks
		\item Tools \& methodologies effectiveness
		\item Topics not delivered with the project
		\item Budget analysis
		\item Lessons learned
		\item Conclusions
	\end {enumerate}
