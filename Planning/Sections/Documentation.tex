\section{Documentation}
\label{sec:documentation}
\subsection{Documentation plan}
Just like the project itself, the documentation will be managed as an iterative product.
Project documentation templates, forming the basis for the documentation deliverables, will be created before the start of phase 3b (research context), while analysis, design and coding documentation will be maintained through the project.

Each iteration delivery, the available set of documentation will be delivered informally towards the project supervisor and, where useful, towards the customer.

\subsection{Documentation deliverables}
The following documentation artifacts will be delivered as part of this project:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Scientific article (individual report per project team member)
	\item Detailed report of the `research context'
	\item Analysis \& design
	\item Test report
	\item Concluding project documentation including all sub documentation artifacts
\end{enumerate}
