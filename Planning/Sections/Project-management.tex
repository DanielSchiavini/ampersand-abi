\subsection{Project governance / roles \& responsibilities}
We distinguish 5 different project parties in the project environment:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The project team
	The project team consists out of Daniel Schiavini and Maarten Baertsoen.
	This team takes the full responsibility for the actual delivery for all project work products consisting out of
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The actual Haskell program code in full conformity with the coding conventions
		\item Exhaustive code documentation
		\item All necessary final and intermediate deliverables to ensure project success such as: project planning and, project methodology as described within this document. 
	\end {enumerate}
	The full list of all work products with their corresponding description is included in this document.
	\item The project supervisor
	The project supervisor is the main contact person for the project team. It is the role of the project supervisor to monitor the project team on a regular basis as well as to provide support and guidance to the project team members both on content and approach.
	It is the responsibility of the project team to send project status updates towards the project supervisor; these status updates will form the basis for the regular alignment meetings. 
	During project execution, it might occur that the effort needed to meet the customer expectations is way over the foreseen budget of the project, measured in hours. 
	Should this situation occur, the supervisor will facilitate customer alignments to adjust the customerâ€™s requirements.
	All efforts spent are therefore reported on a weekly basis to the supervisor who will track the spent effort to make sure that every aspect of the project receives the needed attention.

	\item The customer
	The project will deliver an actual product with all corresponding documentations in a controlled way. 
	The customer's satisfaction is one of the key success factors of this project.

	Although this project is conducted in a educatinal environment, the customer will be treated just like he would be served in a professional environment. 
	\item End-Users
	The Ampersand Parser is currently used by several users groups 
	\item The examiner

\end {enumerate}
