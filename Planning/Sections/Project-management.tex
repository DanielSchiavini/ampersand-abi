\section{Project management (M)}
\label{sec:project-management}
This sections descirbes the project management approach and used techniques to guarantee project succes.
As the project team consists only out of 2 team members, special attention is given to make the project management approach holistic but light.
Holistic to assure that all important aspects with regards to the management of this project are properly covered and lightweight to avoid that the project team loses time in handling unnecessary tasks which only have added value in larger project teams.
\subsection{Project governance / roles \& responsibilities}
We distinguish 5 different project parties in the project environment:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The project team
	The project team consists out of Daniel Schiavini and Maarten Baertsoen.
	This team takes the full responsibility for the actual delivery for all project work products consisting out of
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The actual Haskell program code in full conformity with the coding conventions
		\item Exhaustive code documentation
		\item All necessary final and intermediate deliverables to ensure project success such as: project planning and, project methodology as described within this document. 
	\end {enumerate}
	The full list of all work products with their corresponding description is included in this document.
	\item The project supervisor
	The project supervisor is the main contact person for the project team. It is the role of the project supervisor to monitor the project team on a regular basis as well as to provide support and guidance to the project team members both on content and approach.
	It is the responsibility of the project team to send project status updates towards the project supervisor; these status updates will form the basis for the regular alignment meetings. 
	During project execution, it might occur that the effort needed to meet the customer expectations is way over the foreseen budget of the project, measured in hours. 
	Should this situation occur, the supervisor will facilitate customer alignments to adjust the customerâ€™s requirements.
	All efforts spent are therefore reported on a weekly basis to the supervisor who will track the spent effort to make sure that every aspect of the project receives the needed attention.

	\item The customer
	The project will deliver an actual product with all corresponding documentations in a controlled way. 
	The customer's satisfaction is one of the key success factors of this project.

	Although this project is conducted in a educatinal environment, the customer will be treated just like he would be served in a professional environment. 
	\item End-Users
	The Ampersand Parser is currently used by several users groups 
	\item The examiner

\end {enumerate}


\subsection{Communication}
Regular alignment sessions and communications s are foreseen withtinthe project. The communication plan described below will identify the way the project team will align and communicte with the dfferent project parties

\subsubsection{Internal}
The project team memebers, Dniel and Maarten will align on a weekly basis.
During this meeting, following topics will be discussed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Tasks done
	\item Tasks due
	\item Assignment of next project tasks wihtin the projetc team
	\item Actions
	\item Issues & Risks
\end {enumerate}
Given the project size of the team, Daniel and Maarten will communicate on a regular basis between each other on a informal basis besides this recurrent weekly meeting.
\subsubsection{OU}
A recurrent meeting bewteen the project supervisor and the project team is planned each 3 weeks.
This meeting is an offical feedback meeting regarding the full status of the projects encompassing all important project aspects such as progress, issues and risks. 

During these meetings the supervisor will monitor and steer the project progress and will check the proper project management by consulting the project's statistics. All formal project delivery products which needs to be delivered towards the examinator. 

All documents will be delivered to the project supervisor at least 24hrs before the actual meeting to allow the project supervisor to perform an in depth review .
It is the goal of the projec team members to deliver the to be reviewed documents a couple of days earlier to respect the supervisor's agenda.

\subsubsection{Customer}
The meetings with he customer will be planned carefully both on timing and content to make sure that the customer is not disturbed too much with project questions not relevant for the customer. 

The main principle to identify questions towards the customer is that all questions
