\section{High-level requirements (R-M)}
\label{sec:requirements}
In this section, a list of known requirements is given.
Please note that because the project plan is made in the beginning of the project, only the highest-level requirements can be described.
Also note that the project will be executed in an iterative/agile way, so the requirements will change, and when they do this document might be not updated.

~\newline\noindent
In this section, the abbreviation NAP is used, with the meaning `new Ampersand Parser'.
\dict{NAP}{Ampersand Parser}%

\subsection{Capability requirements}
\req{PL-FUN-010}{Command-line interface}{
	The NAP shall only have a command-line interface.}

\subsection{Required states and modes}
\req{PL-RSM-010}{Forward parsing}{
	The NAP shall provide forward parsing, from ADL to P-structure.}\\

\req{PL-RSM-020}{Backwards parsing}{
	The NAP shall provide backwards parsing, from P-structure to ADL.}

\subsection{External interface requirements}
\req{PL-EIF-010}{File interface}{
	The NAP shall read input text files in ADL format.}\\

\req{PL-EIF-020}{File encoding}{
	The NAP shall read input files with Windows-1252 (also known as ANSI) encoding.}

\subsection{Internal interface requirements}
\req{PL-IIF-010}{Interface with Type Checker}{
	The NAP code shall interface with the Type Checker via the P-structure.}

\subsection{Internal data requirements}
\req{PL-IDR-010}{Generate P-structure}{
	The NAP code shall generate the P-structure in the same manner as the old Ampersand parser currently does.}

\subsection{Adaptation requirements}
No such requirements have been identified.

\subsection{Safety requirements}
Ampersand is not a safety critical application.
Therefore, no such requirements have been identified.

\subsection{Security and privacy requirements}
Ampersand is not a security or privacy critical application.
Therefore, no such requirements have been identified.

\subsection{Environment requirements}
\req{PL-ENV-010}{Windows environment}{
	The NAP shall run in the Microsoft Windows 7 operational system.}

\subsection{Computer resource requirements}
	\subsubsection{Hardware requirements}
	No such requirements have been identified.

	\subsubsection{Hardware resource utilization requirements}
	No such requirements have been identified.

	\subsubsection{Software requirements}
	\req{PL-CSW-010}{Haskell language}{
		The NAP shall be written in the Haskell programming language.}\\
		
	\req{PL-CSW-020}{Haskell compiler}{
		The NAP shall be compiled with GHC version 7.8.3.}

	\subsubsection{Communications requirements}
	No such requirements have been identified.

\subsection{Software quality factors}
\req{PL-SQF-010}{User-friendly errors}{
	The NAP shall give user-friendly error messages for the most common parsing errors.\\
	Note: Discovering which errors are the most common is part of the assignment.}\\

\req{PL-SQF-020}{Code annotation}{
	The NAP source code shall be documented in Haddock format.}

\subsection{Design and implementation constraints}
\req{PL-DIC-010}{Ampersand code base}{
	The NAP shall be implemented in the Ampersand code base.\\
	Note: This also means that NAP shall be implemented in the Haskell programming language, and will use the same compiler as Ampersand does.}

\subsection{Personnel-related requirements}
\req{PL-PER-010}{Project members availability}{
	The project members shall be available for at least an average of 10 hours a week.
}\\

\req{PL-PER-020}{Peer reviews}{
	The project members shall review each other's code and documentation before delivery.
}

\subsection{Training-related requirements}
No such requirements have been identified.

\subsection{Logistics-related requirements}
All deliveries are done online, therefore no logistics requirements have been identified.

\subsection{Other requirements}
No such requirements have been identified.

\subsection{Packaging requirements}
\req{PL-PAK-010}{Git repository}{
	The NAP code shall be managed in the `AmpersandTarski/ampersand' GitHub repository, in the `ABI\_Parser' branch.}

\subsection{Precedence and criticality of requirements}
\req{PL-PAC-010}{Customer wishes}{
	The implementation of the NAP shall have higher priority than any new features or customer wishes}
