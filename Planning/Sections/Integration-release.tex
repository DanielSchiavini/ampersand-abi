\section{Integration \& release}
\label{sec:integration-release}
\dict{branching}{Branching is the duplication of an object under revision control so that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches.}%
\dict{merging}{The reintegration of a branch into the original code}%
The code changes of this project will be done in a separate branch (\texttt{ABI\_Parser}) of the Ampersand GitHub repository (\texttt{AmpersandTarski/ampersand}).
In the end of each sprint, the project members will evaluate whether the integration into the master branch is advised.
If so, the following steps will be taken:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The code has already been merged and tested in the project branch.
	\item The project manager shall send a notification via e-mail to the customer, including the test documentation and any other applicable information, such as the commit identifier (see \autoref{subsec:test-documentation}).
	\item The customer should realize any complementary tests and accept the release.
	\item When the release is accepted, a push request will be issued.
\end{enumerate}
%
It is important to note that any code developed in a sprint should be usable and integrated into the master branch.
If integration is not possible, the sprint can be considered failed.
