\section{Risk management (R-D)}
\label{sec:risk-management}
Risk management is one of the measure taken within the project to guarantee the process quality and hence project success.

The risk management approach consist out of 5 steps

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Risk identification 
	\item Risk qualification
	\item Determine risk mitigation measures
	\item Monitor and control
	\item Evaluate and fine-tune
\end {enumerate}
\subsection{Risk identification }
Every identified risk within the full life cycle of the project will be taken up by the project team. The definition of a risk in this project is  'every event that can influence the project in a tangible negative way'. Of course there can be risks with a positive effect, but these will be merely considered as a 'lucky coincidence'.

All risks will be kept together in a central repository, the risk register, in which a summary with the main characteristics is provided.
The following information is registered for each risk:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Risk ID
	\item Status
	\item Domain
	\item Identification date
	\item Short description
	\item Additional information
	\item Mitigation actions
	\item responsible
	\item date next review
	\item Impact
	\item Likelihood
	\item Risk evolution (status quo, increased or decreased probability/evolution)
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Risk qualification }
Not every identified risk will have the same importance and we will only focus on the risk which are worth our attention.
This means that we will focus on the medium or heavy risks which, if they occur, will have a bad, or sometimes a catastrophic, effect on he project.

The exact qualification of the risk type is based on the risks likelihood, what is the chance of the risk to become a fact, and the risk impact, how hard will this risk hits our project if it happens.

Following matrix identifies the risks qualification based on these 2 parameters:


\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
Impact & \multicolumn{3}{l}{Likelihood}                                                     \\
       & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Low}   & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Medium} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{High}  \\
High   & \cellcolor[HTML]{FFCB2F}M & \cellcolor[HTML]{FE0000}H  & \cellcolor[HTML]{FE0000}H \\
Medium & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}L & \cellcolor[HTML]{FFCB2F}M  & \cellcolor[HTML]{FE0000}H \\
Low    & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}L & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}L  & \cellcolor[HTML]{FFC702}M
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Based on the identified risk type, the risk will be managed accordingly:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item L - Low Risk

	Low risks will be monitored on a regular basis, but no specific actions will be initiated with regards to risk mitigation and risk avoidance.
	\item M - Medium Risk

	Medium risk will be managed in a more pro-active way, risk mitigation options will be documented and these will be taken into account during the risk's life cycle. It is up to the project team to see if the risk is managed actively or if it will be merely monitored.
	\item H-High risks

	The project team will act on high risk with a high sense of urgency. High risks will be investigated in detail, a risk mitigation approach will be installed and the risk will be monitored intensively throughout the risk's life cycle.
\end {enumerate}
 

\subsubsection{Determine risk mitigation measures}
The possible risk management strategies options to cope with each distinct risk are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Risk avoidance

	Actions are undertaken to avoid the risk, meaning that the risk will disappear due to 
	\item Risk reduction

	The risk itself cannot be avoided, but measures are taken to limit the negative consequences in case the risk materializes.
	\item Risk sharing

	This kind of risks cannot be coped with by the project team on its own, therefore the risk mitigation responsibility is shared with other resources or project teams to identify a joint risk approach.
	\item Risk acceptance

	The project teams decides to just accept the consequences of the risk, identifies the risk impact and foresee time and budget to handle with the negative consequences once the risk materializes.
\end {enumerate}

The risk management strategy option will be documented for each distinct risk in the risk register.

\subsubsection{Monitor and control}
The risks are monitored on a weekly basis and the necessary re-qualifications and new/ongoing mitigation actions are discussed where appropriate.

The risk register, together with a status overview, will be discussed with the project supervisor on a regular basis. 
The most important highlights and ongoing mitigation actions or results will be explained in more detail.

\subsubsection{Evaluate and fine-tune}
The evaluation of the risk management approach is not planned in a formal way, but each time an improvement point is identified, the team will evaluate fine-tune activities and implement these where considered useful.
