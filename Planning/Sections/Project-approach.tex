\section{Project approach (-)}
\label{sec:project-approach}
Just like any other project, this project need a fit-for-use approach. 
This section 'project approach' summarizes the project methodology we will apply together with an exhaustive overview of the project planning, milestones and corresponding deliverables.
\subsection{Project methodology}
The main drivers to determine our project methodology is based on the kind of deliverables that needs to be produced due to this project, more specific, the actual technical realization of the project.

We can group the technical realization into 2 categories:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The introduction of a new error message approach to provide clear and useful error messages and warnings towards the end-users
	\item Stand alone modification points toward the Ampersand Parser based on
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Reported issues
		\item Enhancements
		\item Extensions
	\end {enumerate}
\end {enumerate}

Given the stand alone aspect of the modification points, the use of a scrum based approach is quite obvious as we already have a product backlog of topics which can be taken up independently of each other. 

The error messages need somewhat more attention to guarantee that was build up a solid error message architecture. The project team will therefore realize a Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate the correct approach and base architecture. After validation of this POC, the project team will realize the error message architecture and actual implementation in a scrum like approach.
More information on the scrum like approach is described in section ‘Project realization’.


Within this project methodology, following aspect are identified as important to guarantee a qualitative project within time, budget en corresponding to the agreed on project scope : 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Project management
	\item Knowledge acquisition 
	\item Project realization approach
	\item Integration \& release
	\item Testing \& validation
	\item Communication
	\item Documentation
\end {enumerate}

All these approach topics are fully documented within this project plan.
