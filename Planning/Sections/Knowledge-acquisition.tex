\section{Knowledge acquisition (D/M)}
\label{sec:knowledge-acquisition}

\subsection{Domain \& techniques}
\dict{Phase 3a}{Phase of the project when domains and techniques are investigated}%
In the project phase 3a, the project members shall investigate the domain and the techniques available.
Each project member will do a separate analysis, and will present a separate document with their findings.
The planning of the investigation is presented a section per project member.

\subsubsection{Haskell parsing libraries \& User-friendly error messages (R-M)}
This part of the research is going to be executed and documented by Daniel Schiavini.
It is divided in two interrelated parts:
\begin{description}
	\item [Haskell parsing libraries:]
	The current Ampersand parser is created with the Utrecht University parser combinator library (UU.Parsing).
	This library uses monads and combinators and has quite some good features.
	There are, however, other libraries that can provide other feature sets.
	
	The purpose of this research is to choose the library best suited to the development of the new Ampersand parser.
	Some of the libraries available are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Helium
		\item Parsec
		\item Polyparse
		\item Happy parser generator
	\end{itemize}
	There are also advantages and disadvantages on using monads and combinators, which must be researched beforehand.
	The result of this research could also be that the UU.Parsing library is the best choice.
	One big advantage for this library is that the current code base can be very helpful.

	\item [User-friendly error messages]
	The most important feature of the parser that will be built, is that it should generate user-friendly error messages.
	To understand what kinds of messages can be (and should be) generated, a research will be done on what good errors are and how to generate them.
	
	This is also related to the choice of the parsing library, since the chosen library should support the generation of good errors without extensive effort.
	Coincidently, a good source of knowledge are the papers of the supervisor, Bastiaan Heeren, who has done his PhD thesis on the generation of top quality type error messages\cite{heeren-error}.
\end{description}

\noindent
The results of this research will be reported in a separate document, and be added as an appendix of the thesis.

\subsubsection{Business Rules \& Ampersand Users (M)}
This part of the research is going to be executed and documented by Maarten Baertsoen.

\subsection{Research context (R-M)}
\dict{Phase 3b}{Phase of the project when the research context is investigated}%
After understanding more about the domain and the techniques involved with the project, the next step is to understand the context in which the project has been requested.
Besides, the relation of this project with the main research should be made clear.
In the project phase 3b, the focus is on the the use of business rules for IT systems.

Since the relevance of this project in the research can be only well defined later on, only a high-level planning can be given.
This project part will be done in three steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Understanding the research, by reading existing papers and other literature.
	\item Consulting, by formulating questions that can then be asked to the customer (Stef Joosten).
	\item Reporting the findings, in a separate section of the thesis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Knowledge documentation (R-M)}
The project phases 3a and 3b will result in three reports.
Each report should have around 5 pages and will be added to the bachelor thesis.
